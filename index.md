## Few words about me

I am a 5th year student of electronics and telecommunication on Military University of Technology. I am interested in programming software, and hardware aswell. This account was created only for recrutational purposes, and all the projects and code You can find here are and will be mostly written in Swift (Sometimes a bit of Obj-C). Enough of introduction, let's get to the projects!

# BK-Valve

The whole idea of this project was to control the angle in the cars' exhaust sport systems from mobile devices. Both app on iOS, and hardware were created by me. The user is able to manipulate the angle, save his favorite presets and quick launch them. Connection between devices is established by Bluetooth LE. I used following technologies in this projects:

```markdown

- CoreBluetooth
- CoreData
- cocoapods

```

# MTom
This project was created for my friend from the university group. This app allows user to turn on/off, mute, control volume,  and balance of remote music amplifier. User is able to connect to the devices by Bluetooth LE, so the of course i used CoreBluetooth.
